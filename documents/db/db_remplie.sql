Now you are ready to assemble.\nHeat up your olive oil in a small frying pan. Add your corn tortilla for about 20 seconds, flipping if the oil doesn\'t reach the top side.

Lay out a tortilla and add about 2 TBSP of chicken mixture to the middle of your tortilla. Roll up. Fill the remaining tortillas in the same way and line them up next to each other on your cookie sheet, so they are very close to each other, but not touching. This should make two rows on each of your cookie sheets.\nIf two pans are too much for your family, then at this point, take one pan and put it in your freezer. Once the enchiladas are frozen, remove them from the pan and stack them in a double lined ziploc freezer bag.

Set this aside.\nIn a bowl of a standing mixer, beat the eggs for 10 minutes on high speed. The eggs will have the consistency of soft whipped cream. Continue beating on high speed while slowly adding the granulated sugar, one tablespoon at a time. The resulting mixture will have the appearance and consistency of a batter ready to be baked to create a sponge cake. When you lift the wire-whip from the egg mixture, the mixture should fall back to the bowl, as if it was a ribbon. That is why pastry chefs state that beat the egg mixture to a ribbon stage.\nFinally, add the vanilla.\nSet the standing mixer speed to its lowest setting and add the dry ingredients very slowly (i.e. like about one tablespoon at a time). Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl periodically and beat until just all the dry ingredients are incorporated. Caution: over mixing will cause the eggs to deflate.\nSpread the cake batter in the prepared jelly roll pan.\nBake for 12-15 minutes or until the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.
